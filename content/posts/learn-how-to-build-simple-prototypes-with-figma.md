There are two ways to learn the basics of prototyping on Figma:

1. Either you learn directly from their help center, here’s the [link](https://help.figma.com/category/87-prototyping).
2. Or you learn while having fun, so stay here. 🤪

Words are sometimes not enough to express ideas, and they can often be confusing when a designer explains a transition effect to a client or a developer. 

To avoid confusion, one can with prototyping put effects into motion, without the need to code them.

In this article, we’ll go over basic prototyping effects the tool Figma offers, and have fun while using those.

We won’t cover all of them, but this should give you enough ground to get started.

## Setup

When you first create a project, you have an empty canvas. In the <em>Properties Panel</em>, click on <em>Prototype</em> to get the <em>Settings</em>.

In it, you can choose on which <em>Device</em> and <em>Model</em> you’d like to visualize the prototype. Let’s go for the iPhone SE (<em>Device</em>) Rose Gold (<em>Model</em>). 

You can also select the <em>rotation</em> of the phone, and the <em>background color</em> of your prototyping page. I will stick with vertical (<em>rotation</em>) and black (<em>background color</em>).

You have to create at least one frame to launch the <em>prototype view</em>.

If you click on the presentation view button (<em>play</em>) above your <em>command panel</em>, this is what you get:

<figure>

Now, this is useless because we only have one frame. Let’s create two, and tweak the content of the second.

Let’s connect both frames with an arrow, to establish a connection.

<figure>

</figure>    

## Interaction and Animate

Now that both frames are linked, let’s discover how to move with the Interaction and Animate parts.

Here is a snapshot of the multiple Interaction options, they determine how to trigger the prototype:

</figure>    

<strong>On tap</strong>: just click on the screen, and the animation will happen.

<figure>

<figcaption>Click for the lasers</figcaption>
</figure>    
  
<em>Shortcut: in presentation mode, press R to go back to the original frame.</em>

<strong>On drag</strong>: you have to drag your cursor to make it happen.

<figure>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dirugv7dm/image/upload/v1571938442/Articles%20W261/Explore%20Figma%27s%20prototyping%20capabilities%20%28beginner-friendly%29/GIF%20-%20Interaction%20%28Drag%29.gif" alt="Drag interaction on Figma." />
<figcaption>Drag for the lasers</figcaption>
</figure>      

This comes with the Move In Animation, at a speed of 300ms. You can adjust those to define the Interaction.

<strong>While hovering</strong>: just hover, and keep your cursor to make the effect active.

<strong>While Pressing</strong>: keep clicking, and the animation will appear. If you release your mouse, it will disappear.

## Animation: Smart Animate

This very cool <em>Animation</em> creates a more sophisticated transition, let’s explore why.

<figcaption>The day I sink</figcaption>
</figure>    

I create a series of frames of the story I want to showcase, then select the Interaction <em>After Delay</em> to 1ms to have an immediate effect.

<em>Tip: what I do to play around with prototyping is, I open both the Figma desktop app on a screen, and the prototyping view on desktop, to quickly explore options.</em>

## Overflow Behavior

<strong>Horizontal</strong>

This is very useful when you have items outside of your frame (or screen), and you want to show how (for example) a carousel would work or map move.

To make this happen, you must make sure to Frame the elements you want to apply the scrolling effect on. In this example, look at how I put all the items in a single frame.

<figure>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dirugv7dm/image/upload/v1571938929/Articles%20W261/Explore%20Figma%27s%20prototyping%20capabilities%20%28beginner-friendly%29/1_4xm1Lr-b4ApZAT7_nhGgEw_hju0nm.png  " alt="Horizontal overflow behavior in Figma" />
<figcaption>On the left bar, you can see that all the items fall under the same frame</figcaption>
</figure>   

And very importantly, make sure to contain that frame within the parent frame, otherwise, the scrolling effect Overflow Behavior won’t work.

This works:

<figure>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dirugv7dm/image/upload/v1571938978/Articles%20W261/Explore%20Figma%27s%20prototyping%20capabilities%20%28beginner-friendly%29/1_0sLFhTHYGiWoj2sJO9shyQ_cwig4r.png" alt="Important to make the overflow behavior work with the frames." />
<figcaption>Frame within the parent frame validates the behavior</figcaption>
</figure>    

This does NOT work:

<figure>

<figcaption>The prototype will not work</figcaption>

Here is the result:

</figure>   

<strong>Horizontal and Vertical</strong>

Now, let’s say you have a map (or other item) in your design, and want to show how  the interaction would look like when you scroll within it (up, down, left, right), you can use the same Overflow Behavior but with both Horizontal and Vertical scrolling:

<figure>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dirugv7dm/image/upload/v1571939529/Articles%20W261/Explore%20Figma%27s%20prototyping%20capabilities%20%28beginner-friendly%29/Overflow_Behavior_H_and_V_-_Prototyping_roigx8.gif " alt="Horizontal and vertical overflow behavior in Figma" />
<figcaption>Eeeeeeeey stop moving fast</figcaption>
</figure>     

For your design to look neat, make sure to Clip Content, so it looks like this:

<figure>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dirugv7dm/image/upload/v1571939630/Articles%20W261/Explore%20Figma%27s%20prototyping%20capabilities%20%28beginner-friendly%29/1_wzlxz4PtLObTkvV15ianVg_h43cmk.png" alt="Clip your content on Figma to keep your canvas clean" />
<figcaption>Clip your content like a hairdresser</figcaption>
</figure>  
  
And not like this:

<figure>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dirugv7dm/image/upload/v1571939673/Articles%20W261/Explore%20Figma%27s%20prototyping%20capabilities%20%28beginner-friendly%29/1_vzdK8NSMJN_kS8NCOtMYDg_j4roti.png " alt="Clip your content on Figma to keep your canvas clean otherwise it's messy" />
<figcaption>Hard to work in a dirty workspace</figcaption>
</figure>  

And if you want one of your items to stay in the same position while you scroll in a prototype (like the “Imaginary Header” above), make sure to tick <em>Fix position</em> when scrolling:

<figure>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dirugv7dm/image/upload/v1571939723/Articles%20W261/Explore%20Figma%27s%20prototyping%20capabilities%20%28beginner-friendly%29/1_9vuftzaNJ10_b4sbL5dhPg_z8lwri.png " alt="Fix your content on Figma so it scrolls well" />
<figcaption>Fix it before it disappears</figcaption>
</figure>  
 
## Starting Frame

If you are going to have multiple interactions, you want to make sure that your <em>Starting Frame</em> is the correct one before you test your prototype.

Move the arrow to the correct frame:

<figure>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dirugv7dm/image/upload/v1571939777/Articles%20W261/Explore%20Figma%27s%20prototyping%20capabilities%20%28beginner-friendly%29/1_ozFAolbf8xpMhHNlQjyauQ_mgi6zu.gif " alt="Fix the play button on Figma" />
<figcaption>I thought the button was useless</figcaption>
</figure>   
 
## What’s next?

This was a very brief intro to Figma prototyping. If you liked this article, cool.

I am getting deeper into web design, so keep your eyes open on the 1st of the next month, I’ll drop some more savage stuff (responsive web dev, exploring drawing tools, etc.).

## Extra: the Ultimate Prototype

Sometimes, just stick to simplicity, and do your prototyping on paper:
